DESCRIPTION
-----------
This addon makes the GHOST interface (the green-screen computer) taller. The
idea is to eliminate the need to use the up/down arrows so that text won't be
accidentally missed, and so we aren't forced to use the mouse to scroll a
keyboard-based interface.

The addon also enables the following keyboard shortcuts while the text input
field is focused:
• ALT-D: Switch to the Dragon skin
• ALT-I: Switch to the Illuminati skin
• ALT-T: Switch to the Templars skin
• ALT-N: Switch to the Normal skin
• ALT-H: Equivalent to typing "help"
• ALT-R: Equivalent to typing "root"
• ALT-Q: Equivalent to typing "quit"
• ALT-PgDn: Increase window size
• ALT-PgUp: Decrease window size
• PgDn: Equivalent to clicking the down arrow
• PgUp: Equivalent to clicking the up arrow

INSTALLATION
------------
NOTE: Be sure to uninstall version 1 using the instructions found in that
      version's readme.txt before installing version 2.0 or later.

Unpack the archive to <your TSW folder>\Data\Gui\Customized\
