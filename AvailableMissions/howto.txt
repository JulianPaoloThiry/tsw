Steps to create this MissionJournalWindow from the original:

* Copy the original MissionJournalWindow.fla and open it.
* Copy ViewButton from Sources/Components/Buttons.fla into the new file.
* Copy _Icon_Modifier_Lock from Sources/Components/Mission_Components.fla into
  the new file.
* Copy _Icon_Mission_Raid from Sources/Components/Mission_Components.fla into
  the new file. Drag it into the MissionIcons folder and replace the existing
  one (it has the wrong icon).
* Open the properties for _Icon_Mission_Raid, click Export for ActionScript,
  and set the class to "gfx.controls.Button".
* Open the properties for JournalWindow and set the class to "JournalWindow".
* Modify the Font Embedding settings for RusselSquareStd to include only
  Numerals and "(:-. )".
* Change the Publish Settings Output file to something reasonable and publish.
