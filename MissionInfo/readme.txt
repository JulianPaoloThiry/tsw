DESCRIPTION
-----------
Mission Info modifies the mission tracker on the right side of the screen. When
you hover over a mission's icon or text, you'll get a tooltip with the flavor
text of that mission's current tier. Additionally, clicking on the currently
active mission's icon will show any associated image, video, or audio clip. The
Mission Journal can be opened by selecting the active mission in the mission
bar (the part that auto-hides). 


INSTALLATION
------------
Unpack the archive to <your TSW folder>\Data\Gui\Customized\
You should end up with the following files at a minimum:
• \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\MissionTracker\MissionTracker.swf
• \Data\Gui\Customized\Flash\MissionTracker\Modules.xml
Other files may be present but are not required for the add-on to run properly.


UNINSTALLATION 
--------------
Delete the MissionTracker folder mentioned above.
